# My First Website

We were tasked with creating a website on whichever topic we wanted utilizing the skills we had learned over our 2nd week of study

I chose the Yu-Gi-Oh Franchise as I felt it was a topic with enough substance that I could make fairly expansive website around it.

Techniques I used during this project include:

* HTML
* CSS
* Responsiveness
* Bootstrap

My project used a vast amount of media, including over 30 images and at least 5 audio files.

So that the images could survive the strain of being shrunk and enlarged, I needed images of large size and quality.

Overall this project helped me develop my HTML and CSS much further due to the need for my own research when wanting to use a tool not taught to us.
